# k3s on Ubuntu Server

This document covers my experience setting up k3s—a lightweight Kubernetes distribution—on Ubuntu Server. k3s was chosen for its simplicity and low resource requirements, making it ideal for my home lab. Running k3s not only provides container orchestration capabilities but also deepens my understanding of Linux administration in a real-world setting.
