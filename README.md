# Home Lab

Welcome to my Home Lab repository—a living documentation of my journey to build a modern, virtualized infrastructure environment at home. This project showcases hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), virtualization, automation, and orchestration tools, including Terraform, Proxmox, Ansible, and Kubernetes (k3s).

## Project Overview

This repository documents the evolution of my home lab, covering several key components:

- Terraform: Automates the provisioning of Ubuntu Server VMs on Proxmox, laying the groundwork for a scalable and automated infrastructure.
- Proxmox: Hosts the virtual machines and serves as the virtualization backbone of the lab.
- Ansible: Configures and orchestrates the deployment of a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
- k3s: Implements a lightweight Kubernetes distribution to manage cluster nodes.
- Equipment: Details the hardware and network components that power the lab environment.

Over time, this project has evolved significantly—from initial experiments with Terraform to a more integrated system incorporating multiple automation and orchestration tools. This repository not only tracks my technical progress but also serves as a portfolio to demonstrate practical skills in modern infrastructure management.

## Getting Started

While this repository primarily documents my home lab, here are some key entry points:
- Terraform: Explore the terraform directory to see how Ubuntu VMs are provisioned on Proxmox. The detailed steps, configurations, and troubleshooting notes highlight practical challenges and solutions.
- Ansible: Check out the ansible-kubernetes directory for playbooks and guides that automate the setup of a Kubernetes cluster.
- Proxmox & k3s: Dive into the proxmox and k3s directories for insights into virtualization and Kubernetes cluster management.
- Equipment: The EQUIPMENT.md file details the hardware, networking, and other physical components powering the lab.

## Plans & Roadmap

This project is an ongoing effort. Future updates will include:

- Expanded documentation on network setup and equipment integration.
- Enhanced automation for scaling and managing the Kubernetes cluster.
- Integration of monitoring, logging, and security best practices.
- Refinements to certificate management and hardened configurations for production-like environments.

Feedback and contributions are welcome as I continue to refine and expand this home lab environment.

## Final Thoughts

This repository is both a personal learning tool and a portfolio piece, highlighting my passion for automation, infrastructure as code, and modern systems management. It reflects the iterative process of learning, experimenting, and solving real-world problems in a dynamic lab setting.
