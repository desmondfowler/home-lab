# Home Lab

## README.md

Overview of the homelab project, its objectives, and a high-level description of each component.

## Section-level Files

As mentioned in the above, these files contain the detailed information about each section. For example, in the network-stack directory, information about the network setup, including hardware and software used, configuration notes, and troubleshooting tips are housed. The general layout of this repository is as follows:

| Directory        | Documentation File          | Description |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| root             | [README.md](README.md)      | What you're reading! |
| root             | [EQUIPMENT.md](EQUIPMENT.md)        | Starting point, before any additions. |
