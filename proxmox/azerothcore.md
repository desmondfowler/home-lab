# Azeroth Core Server

This document details my journey setting up an Azeroth Core serverâ€”a private gaming server designed for my friends and me, while also serving as a learning platform for server management. The project involved downloading the repository, compiling executables from source, and configuring systemd services to manage both the authserver and worldserver processes.
